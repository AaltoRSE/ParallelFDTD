% An example, if a 1000 Hz band limit is to be achieved, the sampling
% frequency of the domain should be 10,000 Hz.

% Another downside of SRL scheme is that the simulation domain is a so
% called staircase approximation. This can lead to a slight deviation of the
% modes of the space. An interested reader can see [1].

% Load the model from JSON format

% A JSON importer is used in this example. Any format which is possible

% should be a list of vertex coordinates (in meters), and a list of triangle
% indices defining the geometry. Triangle indices have to start from 0.

% Assign reflection coefficients to different layers
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The materials are given as a [N x 20] matrix where
% N is the number of the polygon/triangle in the geometry.
% The format is slightly misleading, only one value is used from the
% vector, namely the admittance of the selected "octave". The variable octave indicates
% which one of the values in the array is used. For example, value 0 fetches the
% first value of the material vector at each triangle.

octave = 0;                                % Lets use the first "octave"

% 20 values is somewhat arbitrary
% number, which rationale is to accomodate 2 variables per 10 octave bands
% to be used in the calculation in future work.
% Now only one variable is used, which is an admittance value

% First set an uniform material
materials = ones(size(indices, 1), 20)*reflection2admitance(0.99); % Number of triangles x 20 coefficients

% Assign material to a layer
